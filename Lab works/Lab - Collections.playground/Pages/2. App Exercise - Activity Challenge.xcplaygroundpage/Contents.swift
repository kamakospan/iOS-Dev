## App Exercise - Activity Challenge
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 Your fitness tracking app shows users a list of possible challenges, grouped by activity type (i.e. walking challenges, running challenges, calisthenics challenges, weightlifting challenges, etc.) A challenge could be as simple as "Walk 3 miles a day" or as intense as "Run 5 times a week." 
 
 Using arrays of type `String`, create at least two lists, one for walking challenges, and one for running challenges. Each should have at least two challenges and should be initialized using an array literal. Feel free to create more lists for different activities.

Then add an else statement that will print "You have chosen multiple challenges."
